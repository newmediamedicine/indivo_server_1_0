Overview
^^^^^^^^

If you are interested in working with Indivo, you probably fall into one or more of
the following categories:

* `General Interest`_: You've heard about this 'Indivo X' project, and want to learn
  more about what it can do. You might want to check out our 
  `non-technical wiki <http://wiki.chip.org/indivo/index.php/Indivo>`_ before 
  diving into this more technical overview.

* `App Developers`_: You want to build applications that enable patients to engage in
  their care, using Indivo's RESTful API to store and fetch medical data. You are
  interested in the API, including functionality and authentication.

* `Indivo Administrators`_: You want to set up and host your own instance of Indivo,
  so that you or others can build applications on top of it. You are interested in
  pulling data into Indivo, setting up users, and managing your instance.

* `Indivo Hackers`_: You are a big fan of Indivo, but realize (as do we) that there 
  are plenty of additions that could make Indivo X even better! You want to dive
  into Indivo's core codebase and fix bugs or add features, and contribute back
  to our open-source community.

Based on your level of interest, check out the documentation below.
