Indivo Document Annotation Schema
=================================

Medical documents can be annotated in Indivo, with a document 
that's added in relation to the annotated document. This is a 
simple schema for these text-based annotations.

Schema:

Coming Soon!

..
  .. include:: /../../../schemas/doc_schemas/reporting.xsd
     :literal:

Example:

Coming Soon!

..
  .. include:: /../../../schemas/doc_schemas/reporting.xml
     :literal:

The relationship to the annotated document is maintained in 
Indivo metadata, and the annotation can, optionally, store the 
SHA256 hash of the referenced document for robustness.
