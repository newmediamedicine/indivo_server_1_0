				It is common to schedule the administration of medications. The MedicationSchedule allows a simple
				schedule for a medication to be created with simple recurrence rules using specifications similar to
				standard calendar entries. In order to create more complex schedules, for example a steroid taper,
				multiple MedicationSchedule documents would need to be created. The MedicationSchedule should be related
				from the appropriate MedicationOrder using the ?healthActionSchedule? relationship type and to the
				appropriate HealthActionOccurrence documents using the ?healthActionOccurrence? relationship type.
				Eventually, MedicationSchedule will be deprecated and HealthActionSchedule will be used instead. This
				will require using a HealthAction to specify the dose and route for the MedicationOrder. Also,
				eventually we should use the complete iCal standard. An xml format is in development
